## Tariffs Reproducibility Package
### Steps Taken to Produce Tariffs Results

#### Accesing the Raw data
1. Go on the [WITS website](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/USA/Year/2023#section3)
2. After accesing The International Trade Indicators interface all the indicators can be viewed individually through the website's integrated "Search For Indicator" search bar.
3. The Indicators selected are  Customs and other import duties (% of tax revenue),Exports as a percent of GDP, Gross Domestic Product at constant 2010 prices,  Imports as a percent of GDP,  Imports of Goods and Services (BoP current USD), Taxes on goods and services (current LCU), and Taxes on international trade (current LCU), GDP (Current USD).
4. The Country Timeseries datasets were downloaded as excel files by clicking the gray download button with an arrow pointing downwards in the top right corner of the online table from the WITS website. The excel files listing the complete WITS indicator observations are recorded for 193 countries across 1988-2022.
5. Go to [ICTD-GRD UNU WIDER](https://www2.wider.unu.edu/content/grd-data-download) website, create an account, then choose to download the Stata file** UNUWIDERGRD 2023 Central Government.dta_.zip (2.44 MB)**

 #### Working with the Data  
1. Open this [do file](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Do%20files/Tarrifs%20Timeseries.do)
   This do-file imports all the Excel files (DomesticTaxRev.xlsx, ExportPGDP.xlsx, GDP(Current USD).xlsx, ImportPGDP.xlsx, ImportValue.xlsx, InternationalTaxRev.xlsx, RealGDP.xlsx, TariffPTaxRev.xlsx), converts them into Stata (.dta) format, and then merges them into a single dataset using Stata’s append command. After constructing the combined database, it filters the observations to keep only the years 2001–2020 and retains only the countries relevant to our analysis: the United States, Australia, France, Israel, Korea (Rep.), Norway, Romania, and Switzerland.
   Because the data are not initially structured in the format required for analysis, the code reshapes the dataset by renaming the year variables to more meaningful labels and converting the year information into a single variable covering 2001–2020. It then restructures the different indicators into separate variables, renames them for clarity, and finally saves the cleaned and reshaped dataset.
2.  Open this [do file](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Do%20files/ICTD-GRD%20data%20do%20file.do) to merge the data that we got from ICTD-GRD. First, it standarizes country names to ensure consistency with WITS and saves the cleaned data set. he code then loads a prepared tariff time series dataset, removes overlapping variables, and merges it with the cleaned GRD tax data by country and year, retaining only successfully matched observations. After saving the merged dataset, the code performs descriptive analysis by labeling variables, generating [summary statistics](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Outputs/Summary_Stats_base.tex), and exporting them to LaTeX. Additional variables such as the [import-to-GDP ratio](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Outputs/Import_GDP_by_Country.tex) and trade balance are created, and country-level summary tables for import dependence are produced. The code also computes correlations between tariff revenue and domestic tax revenue overall and within high- and low-import/GDP country groups. Finally, it generates scatter plots visualizing these relationships for both groups and exports the figures as PDF files ([here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Outputs/fig1_high_import.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Outputs/fig2_low_import.pdf)).

**Link to all the raw data excel files:**
- [Customs and other import duties (% of tax revenue)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/TariffPTaxRev.xlsx): measures the percentage of revenue generated from tariffs imposed in Import Duties
- [Exports of goods and services (% of GDP)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/ExportPGDP.xlsx): measures the percentage of total production of goods and services that is provided to the rest of the world (exports).
- [GDP (constant 2010 US$)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/RealGDP.xlsx): measures countries GDP in constant 2010 US dollars.
- [Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/ImportPGDP.xlsx): measures the percentage of total production of goods and services that the rest of the world provides (imports) in percentage of GDP. 
- [Imports of goods and services (BoP, current US$)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/ImportValue.xlsx): measures the Balance of Payments (BOP) reflected in the economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. It includes the net flow of goods and services, as well as income and expenditures resulting from international transactions
- [Taxes on goods and services (current LCU)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/DomesticTaxRev.xlsx): measures the total amount of taxes paid by individuals, businesses, and other entities on the purchase and consumption of goods and services within a country. LCU means it's in the local currency of the Country. 
- [Taxes on international trade (current LCU)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/InternationalTaxRev.xlsx): measures the taxes imposed on international trade transactions expresed in the local currency.
- [GDP (Current USD)](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/blob/main/Data%20files/GDP(Current%20USD).xlsx): measures the total monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country over a specific period of time.
