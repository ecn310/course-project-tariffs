\section {Question}  \label{sec:question}



{How do taxes on goods and services relate to tariffs in developed countries? How does the relationship depend on a developed country’s GDP and its trade policies?}
\section{Data Overview}  \label{sec:literature}

    Firm-level data from \href{https://wits.worldbank.org}{WITS}
(World Integrated Trade Solution)

\subsection{Data Set 1: Trade relationship between taxes on consumption and international taxes (tariffs) of developed countries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Public reports compiled by the following organizations: WITS' TRAINS Tariff Measures and Preference Beneficiaries, UNCTAD, UN Comtrade and WTO IDB
  \item Focusing on 8 Developed countries with relatively high GDP per Capita from 2001-2020
  \item 8 countries: Australia, France, Israel, Romania, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States.
  \item 4 Economic Variables: GDP, Consumption Tax Rate, International Tax Rate, and Trade Balance
  \item Total of 160 observations
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:theory}
\subsection{WITS Country TimeSeries Data for Australia, Canada, France, Israel, Romania, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States from 2001-2020}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Table 6: International Taxes in current LCU
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Manipulation}
\label{sec:data}

    The next steps will be to analyze each nation’s trade balance as a percentage of GDP over 2001-2020 (comparing the exports and imports datasets from each country) to link its relationship with GDP and consumption and international tax rates. Moving forward, correlation regarding tariff policies and levels of tax rates from developed countries will be evaluated.

\section{Key Variables}
\label{sec:result}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exports of goods and services (\% of GDP)
    \item Imports of goods and services (\% of GDP)
    \item GDP (Gross Domestic Product in current LCU)
    \item Trade Balance (\% of GDP)
    \item Consumption Tax Rate (in current LCU)
    \item International Tax Rate (in current LCU)
\end{itemize}
