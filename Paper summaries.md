Waglé, Swarnim. "Coordinating tax reforms in the poorest countries: Can lost tariffs be recouped?." World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 5919 (2011). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1974850]
- How we found this paper: We got it from lasts year's report.
- Big Picture Question: What are the impmediate revenue implications of trade and fiscal policy reforms?
  - Hypothesis: Trade reforms are not only unlikely to be undertaken, but they can be promptly reversed if the immediate
cost of potential revenue loss is not addressed.
- Specific Question: What are ways to reform trade practices without adversely affecting the fiscal base of poor countries?
    - Hypothesis: As countries move away from trade-basedtaxes, they manage to partially offset trade-based revenue losses with domestic sources of taxes
