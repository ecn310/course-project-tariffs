# Import Reliance and Government Revenue: Testing Tariff–Tax Relationships Across Developed Countries
## Abstract
This paper investigates the relationship between domestic consumption taxes and tariffs in devel-
oped countries, with a focus on how this relationship is influenced by a country’s import-to-GDP
ratio. As countries reduce tariffs, in the context of trade liberalization, governments must explore
alternative revenue sources, such as increasing domestic consumption taxes. We hypothesize that
countries with high import-to-GDP ratios will substitute domestic taxes for lost tariff revenue
more strongly than countries with low import dependency. Using data from 11 developed coun-
tries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland, Israel, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzer-
land, and the United States). We find weak and inconsistent correlations between tariff levels and
domestic tax revenue. Our results suggest that trade dependence alone does not determine fiscal
substitution behavior, and other factors may influence how governments adjust their tax systems
in response to changes in tariff revenue.
